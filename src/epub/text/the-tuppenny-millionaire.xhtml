			<h2 epub:type="title">The Tuppenny Millionaire</h2>
			<p>In the crowd that strolled on the Promenade des Etrangers, enjoying the morning sunshine, there were some who had come to Roville for their health, others who wished to avoid the rigours of the English spring, and many more who liked the place because it was cheap and close to Monte Carlo.</p>
			<p>None of these motives had brought George Albert Balmer. He was there because, three weeks before, Harold Flower had called him a vegetable.</p>
			<p>What is it that makes men do perilous deeds? Why does a man go over Niagara Falls in a barrel? Not for his health. Half an hour with a skipping-rope would be equally beneficial to his liver. No; in nine cases out of ten he does it to prove to his friends and relations that he is not the mild, steady-going person they have always thought him. Observe the music-hall acrobat as he prepares to swing from the roof by his eyelids. His gaze sweeps the house. ‘It isn’t true,’ it seems to say. ‘I’m not a jelly-fish.’</p>
			<p>It was so with George Balmer.</p>
			<p>In London at the present moment there exist some thousands of respectable, neatly-dressed, mechanical, unenterprising young men, employed at modest salaries by various banks, corporations, stores, shops, and business firms. They are put to work when young, and they stay put. They are mussels. Each has his special place on the rock, and remains glued to it all his life.</p>
			<p>To these thousands George Albert Balmer belonged. He differed in no detail from the rest of the great army. He was as respectable, as neatly-dressed, as mechanical, and as unenterprising. His life was bounded, east, west, north, and south, by the Planet Insurance Company, which employed him; and that there were other ways in which a man might fulfil himself than by giving daily imitations behind a counter of a mechanical figure walking in its sleep had never seriously crossed his mind.</p>
			<p>On George, at the age of twenty-four, there descended, out of a dear sky, a legacy of a thousand pounds.</p>
			<p>Physically, he remained unchanged beneath the shock. No trace of hauteur crept into his bearing. When the head of his department, calling his attention to a technical flaw in his work of the previous afternoon, addressed him as ‘Here, you⁠—young what’s-your-confounded-name!’ he did not point out that this was no way to speak to a gentleman of property. You would have said that the sudden smile of Fortune had failed to unsettle him.</p>
			<p>But all the while his mind, knocked head over heels, was lying in a limp heap, wondering what had struck it.</p>
			<p>To him, in his dazed state, came Harold Flower. Harold, messenger to the Planet Insurance Company and one of the most assiduous money-borrowers in London, had listened to the office gossip about the legacy as if to the strains of some grand, sweet anthem. He was a bibulous individual of uncertain age, who, in the intervals of creeping about his duties, kept an eye open for possible additions to his staff of creditors. Most of the clerks at the Planet had been laid under contribution by him in their time, for Harold had a way with him that was good for threepence any pay-day, and it seemed to him that things had come to a sorry pass if he could not extract something special from Plutocrat Balmer in his hour of rejoicing.</p>
			<p>Throughout the day he shadowed George, and, shortly before closing-time, backed him into a corner, tapped him on the chest, and requested the temporary loan of a sovereign.</p>
			<p>In the same breath he told him that he was a gentleman, that a messenger’s life was practically that of a blanky slave, and that a young man of spirit who wished to add to his already large fortune would have a bit on Giant Gooseberry for the City and Suburban. He then paused for a reply.</p>
			<p>Now, all through the day George had been assailed by a steady stream of determined ear-biters. Again and again he had been staked out as an ore-producing claim by men whom it would have been impolitic to rebuff. He was tired of lending, and in a mood to resent unauthorized demands. Harold Flower’s struck him as particularly unauthorized. He said so.</p>
			<p>It took some little time to convince Mr. Flower that he really meant it, but, realizing at last the grim truth, he drew a long breath and spoke.</p>
			<p>‘Ho!’ he said. ‘Afraid you can’t spare it, can’t you? A gentleman comes and asks you with tack and civility for a temp’y loan of about ‘arf nothing, and all you do is to curse and swear at him. Do you know what I call you⁠—you and your thousand quid? A tuppenny millionaire, that’s what I call you. Keep your blooming money. That’s all I ask. <i>Keep</i> it. Much good you’ll get out of it. I know your sort. You’ll never have any pleasure of it. Not you. You’re the careful sort. You’ll put it into Consols, <i>you</i> will, and draw your three-ha’pence a year. Money wasn’t meant for your kind. It don’t <i>mean</i> nothing to you. You ain’t got the go in you to appreciate it. A vegetable⁠—that’s all you are. A blanky little vegetable. A blanky little gor-blimey vegetable. I seen turnips with more spirit in ’em that what you’ve got. And Brussels sprouts. Yes, <i>and</i> parsnips.’</p>
			<p>It is difficult to walk away with dignity when a man with a hoarse voice and a watery eye is comparing you to your disadvantage with a parsnip, and George did not come anywhere near achieving the feat. But he extricated himself somehow, and went home brooding.</p>
			<p>Mr. Flower’s remarks rankled particularly because it so happened that Consols were the identical investment on which he had decided. His Uncle Robert, with whom he lived as a paying guest, had strongly advocated them. Also they had suggested themselves to him independently.</p>
			<p>But Harold Flower’s words gave him pause. They made him think. For two weeks and some days he thought, flushing uncomfortably whenever he met that watery but contemptuous eye. And then came the day of his annual vacation, and with it inspiration. He sought out the messenger, whom till now he had carefully avoided.</p>
			<p>‘Er⁠—Flower,’ he said.</p>
			<p>‘Me lord?’</p>
			<p>‘I am taking my holiday tomorrow. Will you forward my letters? I will wire you the address. I have not settled on my hotel yet. I am popping over’⁠—he paused⁠—‘I am popping over,’ he resumed, carelessly, ‘to Monte.’</p>
			<p>‘To who?’ inquired Mr. Flower.</p>
			<p>‘To Monte. Monte Carlo, you know.’</p>
			<p>Mr. Flower blinked twice rapidly, then pulled himself together.</p>
			<p>‘Yus, I <i>don’t</i> think!’ he said.</p>
			<p>And that settled it.</p>
			<p>The George who strolled that pleasant morning on the Promenade des Strangers differed both externally and internally from the George who had fallen out with Harold Flower in the offices of the Planet Insurance Company. For a day after his arrival he had clung to the garb of middle-class England. On the second he had discovered that this was unpleasantly warm and, worse, conspicuous. At the Casino Municipale that evening he had observed a man wearing an arrangement in bright yellow velvet without attracting attention. The sight had impressed him. Next morning he had emerged from his hotel in a flannel suit so light that it had been unanimously condemned as impossible by his Uncle Robert, his Aunt Louisa, his Cousins Percy, Eva, and Geraldine, and his Aunt Louisa’s mother, and at a shop in the Rue Lasalle had spent twenty francs on a Homburg hat. And Roville had taken it without blinking.</p>
			<p>Internally his alteration had been even more considerable. Roville was not Monte Carlo (in which gay spot he had remained only long enough to send a picture post-card to Harold Flower before retiring down the coast to find something cheaper), but it had been a revelation to him. For the first time in his life he was seeing colour, and it intoxicated him. The silky blueness of the sea was startling. The pure white of the great hotels along the promenade and the Casino Municipale fascinated him. He was dazzled. At the Casino the pillars were crimson and cream, the tables sky-blue and pink. Seated on a green-and-white striped chair he watched a <i>revue</i>, of which from start to finish he understood but one word⁠—‘out,’ to wit⁠—absorbed in the doings of a red-moustached gentleman in blue who wrangled in rapid French with a black-moustached gentleman in yellow, while a snow-white <i>commere</i> and a <i>compere</i> in a mauve flannel suit looked on at the brawl.</p>
			<p>It was during that evening that there flitted across his mind the first suspicion he had ever had that his Uncle Robert’s mental outlook was a little limited.</p>
			<p>And now, as he paced the promenade, watching the stir and bustle of the crowd, he definitely condemned his absent relative as a narrow-minded chump.</p>
			<p>If the brown boots which he had polished so assiduously in his bedroom that morning with the inside of a banana-skin, and which now gleamed for the first time on his feet, had a fault, it was that they were a shade tight. To promenade with the gay crowd, therefore, for any length of time was injudicious; and George, warned by a red-hot shooting sensation that the moment had arrived for rest, sank down gracefully on a seat, to rise at once on discovering that between him and it was something oblong with sharp corners.</p>
			<p>It was a book⁠—a fat new novel. George drew it out and inspected it. There was a name inside⁠—Julia Waveney.</p>
			<p>George, from boyhood up, had been raised in that school of thought whose watchword is ‘Findings are keepings,’ and, having ascertained that there was no address attached to the name, he was on the point, I regret to say, of pouching the volume, which already he looked upon as his own, when a figure detached itself from the crowd, and he found himself gazing into a pair of grey and, to his startled conscience, accusing eyes.</p>
			<p>‘Oh, thank you! I was afraid it was lost.’</p>
			<p>She was breathing quickly, and there was a slight flush on her face. She took the book from George’s unresisting hand and rewarded him with a smile.</p>
			<p>‘I missed it, and I couldn’t think where I could have left it. Then I remembered that I had been sitting here. Thank you so much.’</p>
			<p>She smiled again, turned, and walked away, leaving George to reckon up all the social solecisms he had contrived to commit in the space of a single moment. He had remained seated, he reminded himself, throughout the interview; one. He had not raised his hat, that fascinating Homburg simply made to be raised with a debonair swish under such conditions; two. Call it three, because he ought to have raised it twice. He had gaped like a fool; four. And, five, he had not uttered a single word of acknowledgement in reply to her thanks.</p>
			<p>Five vast bloomers in under a minute! What could she have thought of him? The sun ceased to shine. What sort of an utter outsider could she have considered him? An east wind sprang up. What kind of a Cockney bounder and cad could she have taken him for? The sea turned to an oily grey; and George, rising, strode back in the direction of his hotel in a mood that made him forget that he had brown boots on at all.</p>
			<p>His mind was active. Several times since he had come to Roville he had been conscious of a sensation which he could not understand, a vague, yearning sensation, a feeling that, splendid as everything was in this paradise of colour, there was nevertheless something lacking. Now he understood. You had to be in love to get the full flavour of these vivid whites and blues. He was getting it now. His mood of dejection had passed swiftly, to be succeeded by an exhilaration such as he had only felt once in his life before, about half-way through a dinner given to the Planet staff on a princely scale by a retiring general manager.</p>
			<p>He was exalted. Nothing seemed impossible to him. He would meet the girl again on the promenade, he told himself, dashingly renew the acquaintance, show her that he was not the gaping idiot he had appeared. His imagination donned its seven-league boots. He saw himself proposing⁠—eloquently⁠—accepted, married, living happily ever after.</p>
			<p>It occurred to him that an excellent first move would be to find out where she was staying. He bought a paper and turned to the list of visitors. Miss Waveney. Where was it. He ran his eye down the column.</p>
			<p>And then, with a crash, down came his air-castles in hideous ruin.</p>
			<p>‘Hotel Cercle de la Mediterranee. Lord Frederick Weston. The Countess of Southborne and the Hon. Adelaide Liss. Lady Julia Waveney⁠—’</p>
			<p>He dropped the paper and hobbled on to his hotel. His boots had begun to hurt him again, for he no longer walked on air.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>At Roville there are several institutions provided by the municipality for the purpose of enabling visitors temporarily to kill thought. Chief among these is the Casino Municipale, where, for a price, the sorrowful may obtain oblivion by means of the ingenious game of <i>boule</i>. Disappointed lovers at Roville take to <i>boule</i> as in other places they might take to drink. It is a fascinating game. A wooden-faced high priest flicks a red india-rubber ball into a polished oaken bowl, at the bottom of which are holes, each bearing a number up to nine. The ball swings round and round like a planet, slows down, stumbles among the holes, rests for a moment in the one which you have backed, then hops into the next one, and you lose. If ever there was a pastime calculated to place young Adam Cupid in the background, this is it.</p>
			<p>To the <i>boule</i> tables that night fled George with his hopeless passion. From the instant when he read the fatal words in the paper he had recognized its hopelessness. All other obstacles he had been prepared to overcome, but a title⁠—no. He had no illusions as to his place in the social scale. The Lady Julias of this world did not marry insurance clerks, even if their late mother’s cousin had left them a thousand pounds. That day-dream was definitely ended. It was a thing of the past⁠—all over except the heartache.</p>
			<p>By way of a preliminary sip of the waters of Lethe, before beginning the full draught, he placed a franc on number seven and lost. Another franc on six suffered the same fate. He threw a five-franc cart-wheel recklessly on evens. It won.</p>
			<p>It was enough. Thrusting his hat on the back of his head and wedging himself firmly against the table, he settled down to make a night of it.</p>
			<p>There is nothing like <i>boule</i> for absorbing the mind. It was some time before George became aware that a hand was prodding him in the ribs. He turned, irritated. Immediately behind him, filling the landscape, were two stout Frenchmen. But, even as he searched his brain for words that would convey to them in their native tongue his disapproval of this jostling, he perceived that they, though stout and in a general way offensive, were in this particular respect guiltless. The prodding hand belonged to somebody invisible behind them. It was small and gloved, a woman’s hand. It held a five-franc piece.</p>
			<p>Then in a gap, caused by a movement in the crowd, he saw the face of Lady Julia Waveney.</p>
			<p>She smiled at him.</p>
			<p>‘On eight, please, would you mind?’ he heard her say, and then the crowd shifted again and she disappeared, leaving him holding the coin, his mind in a whirl.</p>
			<p>The game of <i>boule</i> demands undivided attention from its devotees. To play with a mind full of other matters is a mistake. This mistake George made. Hardly conscious of what he was doing, he flung the coin on the board. She had asked him to place it on eight, and he thought that he had placed it on eight. That, in reality, blinded by emotion, he had placed it on three was a fact which came home to him neither then nor later.</p>
			<p>Consequently, when the ball ceased to roll and a sepulchral voice croaked the news that eight was the winning number, he fixed on the croupier a gaze that began by being joyful and expectant and ended, the croupier remaining entirely unresponsive, by being wrathful.</p>
			<p>He leaned towards him.</p>
			<p>‘Monsieur,’ he said. <i>‘Moi! J’ai jete cinq francs sur huit!’</i></p>
			<p>The croupier was a man with a pointed moustache and an air of having seen all the sorrow and wickedness that there had ever been in the world. He twisted the former and permitted a faint smile to deepen the melancholy of the latter, but he did not speak.</p>
			<p>George moved to his side. The two stout Frenchmen had strolled off, leaving elbow-room behind them.</p>
			<p>He tapped the croupier on the shoulder.</p>
			<p>‘I say,’ he said. ‘What’s the game? <i>J’ai jete cinq francs sur huit,</i> I tell you, <i>moi!</i>’</p>
			<p>A forgotten idiom from the days of boyhood and French exercises came to him.</p>
			<p>‘<i>Moi qui parle</i>,’ he added.</p>
			<p>‘<i>Messieurs, faites vos jeux</i>,’ crooned the croupier, in a detached manner.</p>
			<p>To the normal George, as to most Englishmen of his age, the one cardinal rule in life was at all costs to avoid rendering himself conspicuous in public. Than George normal, no violet that ever hid itself in a mossy bank could have had a greater distaste for scenes. But tonight he was not normal. Roville and its colour had wrought a sort of fever in his brain. <i>Boule</i> had increased it. And love had caused it to rage. If this had been entirely his own affair it is probable that the croupier’s frigid calm would have quelled him and he would have retired, fermenting but baffled. But it was not his own affair. He was fighting the cause of the only girl in the world. She had trusted him. Could he fail her? No, he was dashed if he could. He would show her what he was made of. His heart swelled within him. A thrill permeated his entire being, starting at his head and running out at his heels. He felt tremendous⁠—a sort of blend of Oliver Cromwell, a Berserk warrior, and Sir Galahad.</p>
			<p>‘Monsieur,’ he said again. ‘Hi! What about it?’</p>
			<p>This time the croupier did speak.</p>
			<p>‘<i>C’est fini</i>,’ he said; and print cannot convey the pensive scorn of his voice. It stung George, in his exalted mood, like a blow. Finished, was it? All right, now he would show them. They had asked for it, and now they should get it. How much did it come to? Five francs the stake had been, and you got seven times your stake. And you got your stake back. He was nearly forgetting that. Forty francs in all, then. Two of those gold what-d’you-call’ems, in fact. Very well, then.</p>
			<p>He leaned forward quickly across the croupier, snatched the lid off the gold tray, and removed two louis.</p>
			<p>It is a remarkable fact in life that the scenes which we have rehearsed in our minds never happen as we have pictured them happening. In the present case, for instance, it had been George’s intention to handle the subsequent stages of this little dispute with an easy dignity. He had proposed, the money obtained, to hand it over to its rightful owner, raise his hat, and retire with an air, a gallant champion of the oppressed. It was probably about one-sixteenth of a second after his hand had closed on the coins that he realized in the most vivid manner that these were not the lines on which the incident was to develop, and, with all his heart, he congratulated himself on having discarded those brown boots in favour of a worn but roomy pair of gent’s Oxfords.</p>
			<p>For a moment there was a pause and a silence of utter astonishment, while the minds of those who had witnessed the affair adjusted themselves to the marvel, and then the world became full of starting eyes, yelling throats, and clutching hands. From all over the casino fresh units swarmed like bees to swell the crowd at the centre of things. Promenaders ceased to promenade, waiters to wait. Elderly gentlemen sprang on to tables.</p>
			<p>But in that momentary pause George had got off the mark. The table at which he had been standing was the one nearest to the door, and he had been on the door side of it. As the first eyes began to start, the first throats to yell, and the first hands to clutch, he was passing the counter of the money-changer. He charged the swing-door at full speed, and, true to its mission, it swung. He had a vague glimpse from the corner of his eye of the hat-and-cloak counter, and then he was in the square with the cold night breeze blowing on his forehead and the stars winking down from the blue sky.</p>
			<p>A paper-seller on the pavement, ever the man of business, stepped forward and offered him the Paris edition of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and, being in the direct line of transit, shot swiftly into the road and fell into a heap, while George, shaken but going well, turned off to the left, where there seemed to be rather more darkness than anywhere else.</p>
			<p>And then the casino disgorged the pursuers.</p>
			<p>To George, looking hastily over his shoulder, there seemed a thousand of them. The square rang with their cries. He could not understand them, but gathered that they were uncomplimentary. At any rate, they stimulated a little man in evening dress strolling along the pavement towards him, to become suddenly animated and to leap from side to side with outstretched arms.</p>
			<p>Panic makes Harlequin three-quarters of us all. For one who had never played Rugby football George handled the situation well. He drew the defence with a feint to the left, then, swerving to the right, shot past into the friendly darkness. From behind came the ringing of feet and an evergrowing din.</p>
			<p>It is one of the few compensations a fugitive pursued by a crowd enjoys that, while he has space for his manoeuvres, those who pursue are hampered by their numbers. In the little regiment that pounded at his heels it is probable that there were many faster runners than George. On the other hand, there were many slower, and in the early stages of the chase these impeded their swifter brethren. At the end of the first half-minute, therefore, George, not sparing himself, had drawn well ahead, and for the first time found leisure for connected thought.</p>
			<p>His brain became preternaturally alert, so that when, rounding a corner, he perceived entering the main road from a side-street in front of him a small knot of pedestrians, he did not waver, but was seized with a keen spasm of presence of mind. Without pausing in his stride, he pointed excitedly before him, and at the same moment shouted the words, ‘<i>La! La! Vite! Vite!</i>’</p>
			<p>His stock of French was small, but it ran to that, and for his purpose it was ample. The French temperament is not stolid. When the French temperament sees a man running rapidly and pointing into the middle distance and hears him shouting, ‘<i>La! La! Vite! Vite!</i>‘ it does not stop to make formal inquiries. It sprints like a mustang. It did so now, with the happy result that a moment later George was racing down the road, the centre and recognized leader of an enthusiastic band of six, which, in the next twenty yards, swelled to eleven.</p>
			<p>Five minutes later, in a wine-shop near the harbour, he was sipping the first glass of a bottle of cheap but comforting <i>vin ordinaire</i> while he explained to the interested proprietor, by means of a mixture of English, broken French, and gestures that he had been helping to chase a thief, but had been forced by fatigue to retire prematurely for refreshment. The proprietor gathered, however, that he had every confidence in the zeal of his still active colleagues.</p>
			<p>It is convincing evidence of the extent to which love had triumphed over prudence in George’s soul that the advisability of lying hid in his hotel on the following day did not even cross his mind. Immediately after breakfast, or what passed for it at Roville, he set out for the Hotel Cercle de la Mediterranee to hand over the two louis to their owner.</p>
			<p>Lady Julia, he was informed on arrival, was out. The porter, politely genial, advised monsieur to seek her on the Promenade des Etrangers.</p>
			<p>She was there, on the same seat where she had left the book.</p>
			<p>‘Good morning,’ he said.</p>
			<p>She had not seen him coming, and she started at his voice. The flush was back on her face as she turned to him. There was a look of astonishment in the grey eyes.</p>
			<p>He held out the two louis.</p>
			<p>‘I couldn’t give them to you last night,’ he said.</p>
			<p>A horrible idea seized him. It had not occurred to him before.</p>
			<p>‘I say,’ he stammered⁠—‘I say, I hope you don’t think I had run off with your winnings for good! The croupier wouldn’t give them up, you know, so I had to grab them and run. They came to exactly two louis. You put on five francs, you know, and you get seven times your stake. I⁠—’</p>
			<p>An elderly lady seated on the bench, who had loomed from behind a parasol towards the middle of these remarks, broke abruptly into speech.</p>
			<p>‘Who is this young man?’</p>
			<p>George looked at her, startled. He had hardly been aware of her presence till now. Rapidly he diagnosed her as a mother⁠—or aunt. She looked more like an aunt. Of course, it must seem odd to her, his charging in like this, a perfect stranger, and beginning to chat with her daughter, or niece, or whatever it was. He began to justify himself.</p>
			<p>‘I met your⁠—this young lady’⁠—something told him that was not the proper way to put it, but hang it, what else could he say?⁠—‘at the casino last night.’</p>
			<p>He stopped. The effect of his words on the elderly lady was remarkable. Her face seemed to turn to stone and become all sharp points. She stared at the girl.</p>
			<p>‘So you were gambling at the casino last night?’ she said.</p>
			<p>She rose from the seat, a frozen statue of displeasure.</p>
			<p>‘I shall return to the hotel. When you have arranged your financial transactions with your⁠—friend, I should like to speak to you. You will find me in my room.’</p>
			<p>George looked after her dumbly.</p>
			<p>The girl spoke, in a curiously strained voice, as if she were speaking to herself.</p>
			<p>‘I don’t care,’ she said. ‘I’m glad.’</p>
			<p>George was concerned.</p>
			<p>‘I’m afraid your mother is offended, Lady Julia.’</p>
			<p>There was a puzzled look in her grey eyes as they met his. Then they lit up. She leaned back in the seat and began to laugh, softly at first, and then with a note that jarred on George. Whatever the humour of the situation⁠—and he had not detected it at present⁠—this mirth, he felt, was unnatural and excessive.</p>
			<p>She checked herself at length, and a flush crept over her face.</p>
			<p>‘I don’t know why I did that,’ she said, abruptly. ‘I’m sorry. There was nothing funny in what you said. But I’m not Lady Julia, and I have no mother. That was Lady Julia who has just gone, and I am nothing more important than her companion.’</p>
			<p>‘Her companion!’</p>
			<p>‘I had better say her late companion. It will soon be that. I had strict orders, you see, not to go near the casino without her⁠—and I went.’</p>
			<p>‘Then⁠—then I’ve lost you your job⁠—I mean, your position! If it hadn’t been for me she wouldn’t have known. I⁠—’</p>
			<p>‘You have done me a great service,’ she said. ‘You have cut the painter for me when I have been trying for months to muster up the courage to cut it for myself. I don’t suppose you know what it is to get into a groove and long to get out of it and not have the pluck. My brother has been writing to me for a long time to join him in Canada. And I hadn’t the courage, or the energy, or whatever it is that takes people out of grooves. I knew I was wasting my life, but I was fairly happy⁠—at least, not unhappy; so⁠—well, there it was. I suppose women are like that.’</p>
			<p>‘And now⁠—?’</p>
			<p>‘And now you have jerked me out of the groove. I shall go out to Bob by the first boat.’</p>
			<p>He scratched the concrete thoughtfully with his stick.</p>
			<p>‘It’s a hard life out there,’ he said.</p>
			<p>‘But it <i>is</i> a life.’</p>
			<p>He looked at the strollers on the promenade. They seemed very far away⁠—in another world.</p>
			<p>‘Look here,’ he said, hoarsely, and stopped. ‘May I sit down?’ he asked, abruptly. ‘I’ve got something to say, and I can’t say it when I’m looking at you.’</p>
			<p>He sat down, and fastened his gaze on a yacht that swayed at anchor against the cloudless sky.</p>
			<p>‘Look here,’ he said. ‘Will you marry me?’</p>
			<p>He heard her turn quickly, and felt her eyes upon him. He went on doggedly.</p>
			<p>‘I know,’ he said, ‘we only met yesterday. You probably think I’m mad.’</p>
			<p>‘I don’t think you’re mad,’ she said, quietly. ‘I only think you’re too quixotic. You’re sorry for me and you are letting a kind impulse carry you away, as you did last night at the casino. It’s like you.’</p>
			<p>For the first time he turned towards her.</p>
			<p>‘I don’t know what you suppose I am,’ he said, ‘but I’ll tell you. I’m a clerk in an insurance office. I get a hundred a year and ten days’ holiday. Did you take me for a millionaire? If I am, I’m only a tuppenny one. Somebody left me a thousand pounds a few weeks ago. That’s how I come to be here. Now you know all about me. I don’t know anything about you except that I shall never love anybody else. Marry me, and we’ll go to Canada together. You say I’ve helped you out of your groove. Well, I’ve only one chance of getting out of mine, and that’s through you. If you won’t help me, I don’t care if I get out of it or not. Will you pull me out?’</p>
			<p>She did not speak. She sat looking out to sea, past the many-coloured crowd.</p>
			<p>He watched her face, but her hat shaded her eyes and he could read nothing in it.</p>
			<p>And then, suddenly, without quite knowing how it had got there, he found that her hand was in his, and he was clutching it as a drowning man clutches a rope.</p>
			<p>He could see her eyes now, and there was a message in them that set his heart racing. A great content filled him. She was so companionable, such a friend. It seemed incredible to him that it was only yesterday that they had met for the first time.</p>
